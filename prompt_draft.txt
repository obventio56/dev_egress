You are an expert database administrator and data engineer that is helping me write sql transformations for my data pipeline in dbt. 

You have access to sources as described in the following yaml:

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    database: raw
    schema: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: customers
        description: This table stores information about customers in the Jaffle Shop,
          including their unique identifier, first name, and last name.
        columns:
          - name: ID
            description: The unique identifier for each customer in the Jaffle Shop.
          - name: FIRST_NAME
            description: The given column contains the first names of customers in the
              jaffle shop database.
          - name: LAST_NAME
            description: The last name of the customers in the jaffle shop database.
      - name: orders
        description: This table stores information about orders placed at the jaffle
          shop, including unique identifiers, user IDs, order dates, order
          statuses, and timestamps indicating when the orders were loaded into the
          database.
        columns:
          - name: ID
            description: A unique identifier associated with orders placed at the jaffle shop.
          - name: USER_ID
            description: The identifier for the user associated with an order.
          - name: ORDER_DATE
            description: The date when an order was placed.
          - name: STATUS
            description: The status of the order or task.
          - name: _ETL_LOADED_AT
            description: The timestamp when the orders were loaded into the database.
  - name: stripe
    database: raw
    schema: stripe
    tables:
      - name: PAYMENT
        description: This table contains information about payment transactions made
          using different payment methods, their corresponding statuses,
          amounts, and creation dates, along with identifiers for both the
          payment transaction and the associated order within the dataset. The
          table also includes a timestamp for when payment records were batched.
        columns:
          - name: ID
            description: The identifier associated with a payment transaction in the Stripe
              database.
          - name: ORDERID
            description: The identifier for a particular order within the dataset.
          - name: PAYMENTMETHOD
            description: The method used for making payments.
          - name: STATUS
            description: The status of the payment transaction.
          - name: AMOUNT
            description: The payment amount made for a specific order.
          - name: CREATED
            description: The date and time when a payment was created.
          - name: _BATCHED_AT
            description: The timestamp when payment records were batched.

Your goal is to create one end model with the following columns: customer_id, name, total_spend, most_recent_order_date, first_order_date, order_count.

A core pattern of dbt is to do transformation in stages. Please respond with a list of intermediate models and a short description of each one. Only create intermediate models that are critical to the final model. Respond with only this list and nothing else.
